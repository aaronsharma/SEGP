#### Sprints & Project Management 

At the onset of this project the team was investigating various socially important campaigns or messages that could be promoted using a single page app.  During this period extensive use was made of Microsoft Teams as a useful focal point for group meetings. 
Initially ideas where logged in an simple ideas text file on the **ideas branch** of the github repo.   At the same time an  **admin branch** was created to hold records of meetings etc, as this was felt to be a good way to keep creative and business aspects apart and easier to manage.
Later Google Sheets was employed to create a pros and cons list for each idea - the advantage Google Sheets gave us was that it was easy to share and edit, and was more private than the university based Microsoft Teams account.
At this stage some early paper-prototypes were developed to look at the potential of some designs.

- Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a  particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)
- Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of  individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will  all receive the same grade!).
- Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview,  timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the  project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies  for absence etc)
- Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.
