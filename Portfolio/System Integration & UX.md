#### System Implementation 

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams).
- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that  you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).
- Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
- Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment.

#### UX Design 

- Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)
The basic concept of a glacier retreating or expanding depending on the success of the user should be relatively easy to replicate on the computer screen.  The first iteration of the design was determined to be a simple bar graph style graphic.  It would move to the left (i.e. grow) if the user was successful and vice-versa.  It is envisaged that the graph could seemingly animate i.e. redraw itself to display user results over time.

A graph like structure was chosen as it was deemed to be able to demonstrate that all elements of the app were working together.  At it's simplest it could be a single colour graph, but there was scope, as shown below to extend even this simple graphic:

Here there four options, note only three are displayed and only one would ever have been seen on the screen:
i) single colour across whole graphic (not displayed)
ii) single colour for glacier retreating (warm colour choice)
iii) single colour for glacier expanding (cold colour choice)
iv) possibility of split colours - warm beyond 8 kWh and cold below it

Once a crude prototype demonstrates that all the elements of the MEAN app are working the user facing aspects will have a major overhaul.  Early concept designs for the landing page and a results page are shown below.  Note the additional data provided in the result - this extra statement of effect was considered desirable for users such as Dave - as it gave a tangible fact.

- Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.
- UX approach â€“ design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)
- Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)
- Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.
