#### System Implementation 

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams).

- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that  you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).
- Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
- Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment.

#### UX Design 

- Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)
The basic concept of a glacier retreating or expanding depending on the success of the user should be relatively easy to replicate on the computer screen.  The first iteration of the design was determined to be a simple bar graph style graphic.  It would move to the left (i.e. grow) if the user was successful and vice-versa.  It is envisaged that the graph could seemingly animate i.e. redraw itself to display user results over time.

A graph like structure was chosen as it was deemed to be able to demonstrate that all elements of the app were working together.  At it's simplest it could be a single colour graph, but there was scope, as shown below to extend even this simple graphic:

Here there four options, note only three are displayed and only one would ever have been seen on the screen:
i) single colour across whole graphic (not displayed)
ii) single colour for glacier retreating (warm colour choice)
iii) single colour for glacier expanding (cold colour choice)
iv) possibility of split colours - warm beyond 8 kWh and cold below it

A high concept paper-prototype was created based on these ideas.   Note the additional data provided in the result - this extra statement of effect was considered desirable for users such as Dave - as it gave a tangible fact.

Feedback from the prototype was positive.  However two main points arose:
i) drop down menus were unpopular
ii) more detailed information gets in the way of the immediacy of the result.  Maybe it could be something you opt in to see


Following this feedback a faster, less polished paper prototype was created so we could get results backk quicker with less effort.  It removes the drop down menus and the detailed results screen.  Below are two animated gifs of it in action.  It is intended as a computer screen and the users finger represents a mouse cursor.  It is envisaged that data is entered by a mechanical keyboard.  This prototype does look like a tablet or phone with a sliding screen - however this was designed for filming purposes.  Under Covid restrictions there was a limit to how many people could film and operate the paper prototype.  This sliding mechanism allowed the subject to control the display whilst the developer could film the result.  Note these gifs are extracts from the session

Feedback from this session proved advantageous.  Having a physical object that could be interacted with versus the higher concept design pages previously used opened up important points that had not previously been visualised:
i) users reported frustration at not being able to go back and change things.**It became apparent that our design was maybe not functioning like a single-page app**, and that the whole design should be incorporated on the one screen (as seen in this quick whiteboard sketch).

ii) the main difference between using the app for fun and having an account was the ability to track usage over time.  No design thus far had incorporated a calendar aspect.
This raises further system design questions - do we allow the user to change the date e.g. enter data for yesterday?  Or is it solely one day at a time?


#### Paper Prototype Issues

It should be noted that Covid had a massive impact on the quantity and quality of tests that could be run.  With the developers limited to their household bubbles there was maybe a lack in the age ranges of people tested.  Further, it is highly unlikely that subjects, knowing the developers personally, would engage in the process without some positive bias.
Outside of Covid the paper prototypes could have been tested within the wider University campus, as well as within family units - extending the quantity and age ranges quite substantially.  Likewise, testing in public spaces and therefore attracting the greatest possible feedback was unavailable to use.  Whilst the use of social media was considered, the burn out and widespread national apathy created by the various lockdowns meant we negated this idea. 


#### Creating the UX

Once a crude prototype demonstrates that all the elements of the MEAN app are working the user facing aspects will have a major overhaul.  Early concept designs for the landing page and a results page are shown below.

  Employing user feedback from the first paper prototypes the front end designs were coded.  These will be revised following the developments from the second prototype:

- Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.
- UX approach â€“ design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)
- Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)
- Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.
