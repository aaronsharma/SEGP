#### 1. Individual Power Use

Given the scale of climate change, and the vast reductions required in greenhouse gas emissions, why focus on the individual?  Can attention to the micro scale be worthwhile?

The answer is a surprising yes.  In a 2011 report for the Department for Environment,Food & Rural Affairs, the Energy Saving Trust observed:

“Domestic energy use in the UK accounts for over a quarter of the total CO2 emissions of the country. We need ...to ensure that the residential sector plays its part in helping to achieve the government’s goals: a 34 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020; 50 per cent by the mid-2020s; and the ambitious 80 per cent reduction by 2050. We need evidence to assess the potential for the UK’s households to lower their energy usage, discover where the potential for big savings lie, help people save money on energy bills and lead more environmentally friendly lifestyles; but ideally without a material reduction in their comfort or perceived quality of life.” (pages 4 and 5 https://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/reports/PoweringthenationreportCO332.pdf ).

**That last sentence is the focus of Glacier View – to help people lead more environmentally friendly lifestyles without material reduction.**  Our fun little app will try and steer users away from big ticket power usage items.
The Energy Saving Trust found that people watched television for 6 hours a day – if we can switch just one hour of that viewing to a tablet or mobile screen, we would see a substantial reduction on the micro level.

Our idea will primarily focus on consumer electronics/computing – a field that according to EST report uses one quarter of the domestic power usage.  For now we target that one quarter of one quarter of all Carbon Dioxide emissions.  The app can well be expanded into the whole domestic power consumption area.

Of course it would need many thousands or millions of people to uptake this kind of activity change, for the results to be observed at the macro level.  
That change will come, and it may be ideas like Glacier View that help nudge the population towards this.


Most importantly, it lays bare the magnitude of the task required to ensure UK citizens reduce their energy use and contribute to the emergence of a low-carbon future.

#### 2. The Nudge Unit

When we talk about nudging people towards changing their behaviour we are on firmer ground than may be expected.  The use of psychology and behavioural economics to this end has been an important part of both US and UK politics, favoured by both the Cameron and Obama administrations.


Conceived in the book, Nudge, written by US economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, its main proposal was “that instead of ordering people around or leaving them alone to behave in ways damaging to themselves or others, the state can “nudge” them into making better decisions by framing their choices differently.”  https://www.ft.com/content/571eef16-8d99-11e3-9dbb-00144feab7de 

In the UK the Behavioural Insights Unit (aka the nudge unit), was part of the Government Cabinet Office until being successfully spun off into a private enterprise that is now a multi-national business.

Whilst successes can be measured in specifics, e.g. increasing the number of people willing to be [organ donors](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/10/nudge-unit-pushed-way-private-sector-behavioural-insights-team)  in this same Guardian article they talk about “careful design...so that enough marginal consumers drive producers to reformulate their products.”

That is the kind of nudge that Glacier View could be a part of.  By slightly nudging the consumers power usage we also slightly nudge them towards greener technology and living.  Where the consumers go, companies will surely follow.  It is here, that by targetting domestic power usage, we can eventually diverge into changing industrial and commercial mindsets too.

There will of course be early market adopters, e.g. Amazon and its [100,000 electric vehicles](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-creating-fleet-of-electric-delivery-vehicles-rivian-2020-2?r=US&IR=T) and plan to be Carbon Neutral by 2040   Change is coming, and it’s about nudging people towards the acceptance of the change.
One thing is for certain, having looked into this, members of our team are changing their electricity usage.  Just one less coffee a day, adds up over 27 million households.

#### 3. The Power Game

The usage of electricity is typically measured in kilo watt hours (kWh) with energy generation being measured in Megawatt hours (MWh) or even Gigawatt hours.  These units of measurement follow the standard lines of 1 GWh = 1000= MWh, and 1 MWh = 1000 kWh, and 1 kWh = 1000 watts, with watts being the usual measurement at the consumer level.  For context 1 kWh (1000 watts) is the equivalent of boiling a kettle ten times, or watching television for seven hours.*

It has been calculated by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy that the average household uses approximately 8 kWh of electricity every single day.*  Naturally there is quite a range from low use, small households, to larger high use households, however targetting an average household usage enables us to set a clearly defined target to our users.  You are usually either below or above the average.

The typical usage can be further broken down into demand according to end use*:

</p>


From general consumption is it of course possible to find highly specific power usage data down to the individual device and version number.  Unfortunately, whilst available, this data is usually held by individual manufacturers, and obtaining a comprehensive collection of specifications is more problematic.  However websites such as The Power Consumption Database http://www.tpcdb.com/ have been collating such data into fairly substantial collections (see image below).

#### 4. Gamifying the Environment

Using gamification to carry important environmental messages in fun ways that does not preach to the players is a challenge, and it is useful to see how others have approached this process.  While we will focus on the computer game market it is not the sole provider of environmental game solutions.  It is worth considering the wider games market where board games such as Photosynthesis https://www.blueorangegames.com/index.php/games/photosynthesis  and the STEM educational card game GO Extinct! https://www.flinnsci.com/go-extinct/fb2207/ are well worth looking at and playing.

As ours is a single-page application, we will primarily focus on projects that could be portable to the part of the market we are attempting to reach.  It would be remiss to not mention **Among Ripples**, by Eat Create Sleep https://eatcreatesleep.itch.io/amongripples
![among](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61804643/114318991-5c447a00-9b07-11eb-9c9d-14dbc62e526a.jpeg)
It's a glorious looking ecosystem management simulator, where the player controls a lake ecosystem.  Developed alongside ecologists to ensure scientific accuracy, its look and scope are beyond our project, but demonstrate the potential that environmental games have.


The current largest freeware game is **C-Roads**, from Climate Interactive.  At its core is a sym game where the player represents a country whose environmental policies can be seen affecting the earth https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/c-roads/  

<p align="center">
  <img width="797" height="427" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61804643/114319048-b0e7f500-9b07-11eb-8d20-2c21e4c75c83.jpg">
</p>

C-roads is a serious contender, using MIT research, and all of the modelling and assumptions behind the algorithms are openly available on their website.  here however the focus is on the national or multi-national level, whereas ours will focus on the individual.  In some ways Glacier View and C-roads are bookends of the same genre.
At this point in the development cycle, we can not attempt to incorporate such a sophisticated model as theirs.  However we can see the advantages in being able to express such sophistication as a draw for the more scientifically orientated user.  Likewise the openness of the algorithms is commendable, and once we move from a relative model it may be wise to follow this path.  What we can take from C-roads is the immediacy of the design, how the graph lines change quickly, giving instance user feedback.


On a scale similar to ours is **Forest** https://www.forestapp.cc/
![forest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61804643/114319026-931a9000-9b07-11eb-8d14-6553b3dc52f0.jpg)
Here the focus is less environmental and more about focus.  This is an app that gets you to focus your attention on something you want to do by removing the distraction of your phone.  It does this by starting to grow a tree - if you don't use your phone the tree grows, but it dies if you give in to temptation.  Through the use of virtual coins youcan also donate to reforestation work in the real world.
Similarly to Forest, Glacier View is using the idea of nudging people's actions towards a positive result.  Their tying it to real world reforestation is a fantastic further step, and we may well consider some form of tangible real world effect too.

#### 5. Relating Our Project To The Problem

As discussed in the introductory General Background and Motivation here, [Project Report](https://github.com/aaronsharma/SEGP/blob/main/Project%20Report.md) **approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions are emitted from electricity generation and this contributes to the greenhouse effect and therefore, growing global temperatures and loss of the ice sheets.**

It would be sheer chutzpah to claim that our project can solve such a problem, and that is why we have examined the principles behind nudging the public behaviour.  By using the simple and appealing graphic of a growing or shrinking glacier, we can demonstrate the individual effect of each users power consumption, and through that, hopefully make them think about their behaviour.

Remember there are 27.8 million households. If one member of each household drank just 1 less hot drink a day that would be 27.8 million * 0.25kWh = 69500 less kilo watt hours required per day.  Over a year that is  24742000 fewer kWh of electricity required - or approximately 25 GWh.
According to this 2012 [report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/267585/Sub-national_electricity_consumption_factsheet_2012.pdf) from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, London annually consumes 40 000 GWh.  So everybody drinking one less cup of tea a day over a year would be the equivalent of powering London for about 6 hours!  That is the scale of the problem.

Of course using renewable energy, better battery design, etc all these elements will bring about a greater change. Yet with the ever increasing sales of gadgets and devices, any impact we can bring on to overall consumer device usage will help.  As we develop our algorithms to respond to the users lifestyle, we may affect greater change.
What we would like to think is **that having read this report, you will think twice before that next cuppa, you may play on your phone instead of your console, or may go for a walk instead of watching tv for an hour. That is the power of the nudge, that is how we can dream to bring change.**


#### 6. The Number Game

At this point in the development cycle it became apparent that the power usage data for each and every device available to the consumer was both unwieldy and complex.  Finding information sources such as The Power Consumption Database and porting their information into a usable format would, it itself, be a full time project.

On the other end, for the user, having the ability to select almost any device manufactured  would be overwhelming and counter productive.  the end user wants snappy fast feedback, and not having to spend time using drop down menus and the like to find a device.

Whilst we may be able to open the scope up at a later date, it was decided that for this round of development, instead of using device accurate data, we would instead use a relative system of numbers that was average for those particular devices.
Again, to keep the scope small enough to not overwhelm the user, but complex enough to demonstrate the proof of concept we decided to limit the types of devices (see table below);

We had to make some assumptions based on average use.  These are:
-  Average household electricity use works out at around 8kWh broken down into
- Cold appliances 63%
-  Wet appliances 10%
- Cooking 7%
-  Lighting 6%
-  Consumer electronics 4%

As we’re mostly looking at consumer electronics that only gives us 4% of daily use to use as a basis to change people’s energy use.  As such, it made sense to add big ticket items, a washing machine and kettle into the app.

If we remove cold appliances, cooking and lighting from the mix – that’s approximately 75% of the daily average , or 6 kWh,  leaving 2 kWh as our focus of attention. 

To simplify the maths, this 2 kWh will be multiplied by 10 - giving us a target score of 20.  

From that this relative usage table was drawn up, with the devices accorded values that mimic the average for said device and places it within the 20 point score system:

\* average use = 1.5 hours so 2kWh * 1.5
\** average use 5 mins to boil = 3 wWh /12
\*** rounded up to include routers etc
\**** averaging out for higher end laptops



EXAMPLES:

1) Hannah has 5 cups of coffee a day (2.5 x 5 = 12.5). 
     Plays her PS5 for 5 hours a day on the large tv (5 x 2 x 2 = 20)
     Uses her phone for about 2 hours (0.25 * 2) = 0.5

TOTAL 33
Average is 20.  She is above average.
We could use tips to suggest drinking more water vs coffee.  Maybe play a bit more on the phone than the PS5.


2) Dave has 2 cups of tea per day (3 X 2.5 = 7.5)
    He’s coding Java for 10 hours a day on his laptop (1 X 10 = 10);
    Unwinds by watching tv for an hour (1 x 2 = 2)

TOTAL 19.5
Under average – but we could tip him to maybe go for a walk, 10 hours of Java is not good for anyone!
