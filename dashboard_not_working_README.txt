I built the dashboard in a separate folder to the git project as I didn't
realise we would be using it with the project

I copied and pasted the folder - but it looks like Express etc needs to be
installed in the same folder..?

So it works locally on my computer from the original folder, but will
not work from the git repo.

If anyone has built their's within the git folder, please delete this version
and push yours.
