Anyone should be able to add an idea down here, so we have a list of ideas
that we can discuss and choose from - all git time-stamped.

CAUTION.  LAST YEAR THEY KEPT ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS TO THE BRIEF AS THEY
WENT ALONG, SO BE READY FOR THAT

BRIEF:	Your central task as a team is to build a fully functioning single
        page application page...  based around the concept of "serious play."
        It has to address real-world problem or raise the profile of a 
        serious issue.

ISSUE/IDEA:

1) Plastic/rubbish on beaches    game where crab collects and bins rubbish
   before the screen gets covered in trash.  

2) Homeless person click & point simulator to understand hardships of
   homelessness
	 - like old flash web school/horror games.
	 - POV on street, options for actions = (1) use money for shelter
           (2) use money for food etc

3) Interactive page that shows what the screen looks like for visually impaired
   and how it'd be after accessibility has been factored in (also possible
   to do with hearing issues eg hyperacusis)
    - see https://twitter.com/AutSciPerson/status/1359353595314008065?s=20

4) Model the spread of corona virus with and without
   restrictions/masks/vaccination could be emojis moving randomly bumping
   into each other
   they turn green when infected, you choose to add someone wearing a mask
   or not wearing a mask see how it changes the spread.

5) A system to encourage cleaning up beaches.  It tracks location, items found,
   date etc and rewards you with certificates, league tables and bespoke
   environmental info 

6) A heat map for depression/anxiety. Users can share their state and location, 
   The data cumulates to a heat map of mental wellbeing based on location.
   Include links for where to seek help but overall just a comforting way to see
   other people in your area also feel the same.

7) A way to find new music based on location and support local bands while live venues
   are closed. Allow bands to sign up add a location and share their music. Users would 
   see a map and be able to scroll around finding bands they might not have heard of from 
   their local area.

8) A map that's a little bit like google map which can find restaurant and cafes but not 
   so much function as google map. Users could upload pictures, write comments and mark them.

9) Based on Fenners/Shiruo's ideas - a heat map for things you like, eg sport, hobbies
   etc.  You can see if there are like minded people nearby - more importantly in current
   climate local cafes/pubs etc can see this too - and could use that info to hold events
   to attract people e.g "50 people here like board games, lets have a games night"

10) Glacial View - app that monitors the computer/device usage and uses that to calculate
    what damage that would do to the glaciers over time... can you slow (or if you prefer - hasten the
    end of humanity)...  Can we nudge the user into less device usage?
