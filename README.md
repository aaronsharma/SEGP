Proposals

Treasure Hunt: 

Using the Foursquare (?) API – select a series of related locations – all the coffee shops in 1 mile etc... can you find the least polluted route to them?  Maybe using air pollution data, or air pollution sensor, or traffic data to gamify the results.  Challenge your friends and find the healthy routes through your city.  Maybe the person who finds the best route is bought a coffee (or pizza, or ice-cream whatever) by the losers. 

Eventually accumulated data could determine best pedestrian routes in polluted areas to try and reduce illnesses etc – councils/health service may use the data? 

 

Accessibility Demonstration App: 

You have to navigate a webpage that has been designed to mimic what it could look like for people of restrictive vision/auditory problems (see ideaslist on our repo).   It then shows you how it could be improved with accessibility features. 

Get points for navigating – maybe options on how to improve the page and you get points for picking the better options and improving user experience?  

Possibility that it displays code snippets to help accessibility once the game is complete – so you can copy and paste immediately into your own web page? 

Who is this for? Is it to encourage developers to include more accessibility options? Is it to raise awareness? 

Clean the Beaches: 

Simple game with a crab trying to move rubbish off the beach into a bin – maybe Tetris style, clear the beach before it fills up.  As you grab an item there’s a brief into window that tells you how long that item takes to upgrade. 
Points for the cleanest beach 

 

 

Homelessness Awareness App 

Point & Click game to understand the complexities in living on the streets, via simulating the tough decisions that need to be made by homeless people. 

Dynamically loads new options as choices are made. 

Perhaps include donation option and partner with local Bristol Charities/ Authorities.
