GLACIER VIEW

An app designed to nudge people's behaviour in a fun way!

By entering specific device usage our app calculates the 
amount of electricty consumed by the user.  We then display
that as a Glacier that either melts or grows depending on:

i) usage versus national average (UK for prototype)

ii) individuals historical usage

The app wil give hints at improving the users' score e.g. 
watching DVD/Blu-ray/tv will score less than streaming 
due to high environmental use of cloud storage.
