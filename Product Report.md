#### Introduction 

Using the United Kingdom as an example:

### the AVERAGE household uses 8kWh of electricity a day
### there are 27.8 MILLION households

### if every household used 0.1kWh less power a day

### in a year it would SAVE equivalent of nearly 600 000 barrels of oil being consumed

  Picture: Melting ice-caps from NASA data

Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have melting, a process that has accelerated over recent years, as evident in  the image above, created from NASA imagery.
Human activities are at the root of this increase in the speed of change. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have subsequently raised global temperatures in a process known as the greenhouse effect.  This temperature change is more prominent at the poles, where the retreat of the ice is most pronounced.

The Arctic is now warming twice as fast than anywhere else on earth. The sea ice there is declining by more than 10% every 10 years. As the ice melts, darker patches of ocean start to emerge, eliminating the effect that previously cooled the poles, creating warmer air temperatures and in turn disrupting normal patterns of ocean circulation.  What happens here has consequences across the entire globe. As sea ice and glaciers melt and oceans warm, ocean currents will continue to disrupt weather patterns worldwide. Fish migrations will change affecting the fishing industry. Certain sea-life species, such as coral, may go extinct due to warmer conditions.  Coastal and river communities will continue to face expensive disaster recovery bills due to flooding and storms become more intense. In the first three months of 2021 unexpected weather events have taken down the power grid of the US State of Texas.

**Approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions are emitted from electricity generation **

One way to help limit future damage is to reduce CO2 emissions, and one way to do that is to decrease our use of electricity.  That is where Glacier View comes in.
