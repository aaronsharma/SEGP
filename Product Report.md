## 						    PROJECT REPORT



### Why Team 16?  Is it numerologic?  Is it because we love Matt 

#### Damon in The Martian and therefore love hexadecimal?  Or is it because we 

##### 											                         were assigned that desk in class?

nb: git branches admin logs our meetings etc and git branch ideas contains the ideas we've been examining.  Parts of these
will be rolled into this project report

#### Introduction 

- Abstract. Motivation for the project, framing of the problem and a high-level overview of the system.

- Project Objectives. The high level goals of the project and the  contribution towards solving the problem. A checklist against which the  team can evaluate their success.

- Video. Short (1-2min) demo video to explain your system (think Kickstarter)

  

#### Background and Motivation 

- Background literature. Academic research review.

####Gamifying the Environment - Current Games

Using gamification to carry important environmental messages in fun ways that does not preach to the players is a challenge, and it is useful to see how others have approached this process.  While we will focus on the computer game market it is not the sole provider of environmental game soultions.  It is worth considering the wider games market where board games such as Photosynthesis https://www.blueorangegames.com/index.php/games/photosynthesis  and the STEM educational card game GO Extinct! https://www.flinnsci.com/go-extinct/fb2207/ are well worth looking at and playing.

As ours is a single-page application, we will primarily focus on projects that could be portable to the part of the market we are attempting to reach.  It would be remiss to not mention **Among Ripples**, by Eat Create Sleep https://eatcreatesleep.itch.io/amongripples
![among](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61804643/114318991-5c447a00-9b07-11eb-9c9d-14dbc62e526a.jpeg)
It's a glorious looking ecosystem management simulator, where the player controls a lake ecosystem.  Developed alongside ecologists to ensure scientific accuracy, its look and scope are beyond our project, but demonstrate the potential that environmental games have.


The current largest freeware game is **C-Roads**, from Climate Interactive.  At its core is a sym game where the player represents a country whose environmental policies can be seen affecting the earth https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/c-roads/  

![C-Roads](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61804643/114319048-b0e7f500-9b07-11eb-8d20-2c21e4c75c83.jpg)

C-roads is a serious contender, using MIT research, and all of the modelling and assumptions behind the algorithms are openly available on their website.  here however the focus is on the national or multi-national level, whereas ours will focus on the individual.  In some ways Glacier View and C-roads are bookends of the same genre.
At this point in the development cycle, we can not attempt to incorporate such a sophisticated model as theirs.  However we can see the advantages in being able to express such sophistication as a draw for the more scientifically orientated user.  Likewise the openness of the algorithms is commendable, and once we move from a relative model it may be wise to follow this path.  What we can take from C-roads is the immediacy of the design, how the graph lines change quickly, giving instance user feedback.


On a scale similar to ours is **Forest** https://www.forestapp.cc/
![forest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61804643/114319026-931a9000-9b07-11eb-8d14-6553b3dc52f0.jpg)
Here the focus is less environmental and more about focus.  This is an app that gets you to focus your attention on something you want to do by removing the distraction of your phone.  It does this by starting to grow a tree - if you don't use your phone the tree grows, but it dies if you give in to temptation.  Through the use of virtual coins youcan also donate to reforestation work in the real world.
Similarly to Forest, Glacier View is using the idea of nudging people's actions towards a positive result.  Their tying it to reworld reforestation is a fantastic further step, and we may well consider some form of tangable rreal world effect too.


- Clear definition of the problem. How does your project relate to the above? We will be marking the ability of your team to identify a  worthwhile and important problem and clearly articulate the scope and  challenge of the problem.



#### System Implementation 

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams).
- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that  you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).
- Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
- Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment.

#### 

#### UX Design 

- Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)
- Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.
- UX approach – design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)
- Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)
- Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.

#### 

#### Sprints & Project Management 

- Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a  particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)
- Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of  individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will  all receive the same grade!).
- Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview,  timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the  project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies  for absence etc)
- Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.

#### 

#### Evaluation 

- Details of how you evaluated your designs (techniques used &  awareness of their limitations). Description of  techniques suitable for your particular design. A timeline of evaluation of your design.
- Unit testing / Functional testing.
- User acceptance testing. Evaluation of your design with users – methods undertaken, findings, implications.

#### 

#### Conclusion

- Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).
- Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did  your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met
- This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)
- Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.
- Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
