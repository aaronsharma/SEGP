#### Introduction 

- Abstract. Motivation for the project, framing of the problem and a high-level overview of the system.

- Project Objectives. The high level goals of the project and the  contribution towards solving the problem. A checklist against which the  team can evaluate their success.

- Video. Short (1-2min) demo video to explain your system (think Kickstarter)

  

#### Background and Motivation 

- Background literature. Academic research review.
- State of the art survey. Current industry review.
- Clear definition of the problem. How does your project relate to the above? We will be marking the ability of your team to identify a  worthwhile and important problem and clearly articulate the scope and  challenge of the problem.



#### System Implementation 

- Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams).
- Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that  you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).
- Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
- Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
- Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
- Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment.

#### 

#### UX Design 

- Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)
- Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.
- UX approach – design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)
- Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)
- Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.

#### 

#### Sprints & Project Management 

- Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a  particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)
- Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of  individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will  all receive the same grade!).
- Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview,  timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the  project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies  for absence etc)
- Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.

#### 

#### Evaluation 

- Details of how you evaluated your designs (techniques used &  awareness of their limitations). Description of  techniques suitable for your particular design. A timeline of evaluation of your design.
- Unit testing / Functional testing.
- User acceptance testing. Evaluation of your design with users – methods undertaken, findings, implications.

#### 

#### Conclusion

- Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).
- Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did  your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met
- This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)
- Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.
- Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
