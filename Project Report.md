#### Abstract 
To develop a fun and non-preaching app that engages with the users usage of electricity and gently attempts to nudge the user towards consuming less power.  It should demonstrate that whilst on an individual level these changes are tiny and have very little impact on the user's lifestyle.  However when looked at en masse, the combined numbers of all users can affect some meaningful change.


#### Project Objectives
- Devise a fun single page app
- Create a realistic model of power usage
- Develop a database that can manipulate the model
- Develop a database that can track the users usage over the long term
- Create fun, instant interactive graphics so the user gets instant gratification and feedback

  Picture: Melting ice-caps from NASA data
  </p>

Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have melting, a process that has accelerated over recent years, as evident in  the image above, created from NASA imagery.
Human activities are at the root of this increase in the speed of change. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have subsequently raised global temperatures in a process known as the greenhouse effect.  This temperature change is more prominent at the poles, where the retreat of the ice is most pronounced.

The Arctic is now warming twice as fast than anywhere else on earth. The sea ice there is declining by more than 10% every 10 years. As the ice melts, darker patches of ocean start to emerge, eliminating the effect that previously cooled the poles, creating warmer air temperatures and in turn disrupting normal patterns of ocean circulation.  What happens here has consequences across the entire globe. As sea ice and glaciers melt and oceans warm, ocean currents will continue to disrupt weather patterns worldwide. Fish migrations will change affecting the fishing industry. Certain sea-life species, such as coral, may go extinct due to warmer conditions.  Coastal and river communities will continue to face expensive disaster recovery bills due to flooding and storms become more intense. In the first three months of 2021 unexpected weather events have taken down the power grid of the US State of Texas.

**Approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions are emitted from electricity generation **

One way to help limit future damage is to reduce CO2 emissions, and one way to do that is to decrease our use of electricity.  That is where Glacier View comes in.

**By creating a glacier that represents the electricty power consumption of the individual users, we will use the artifice of demonstrating either the destruction or growth of the ice to give the user a personal interest in modifying their own behaviour.**
